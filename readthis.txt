Just download and import db.sql or db_data.sql from /backend/resources/ into MySQL.
Modify core.php to your MySQL credentials.

This is the file structure.
  index.php - the main page people see when they access the website
  
  /backend/ - folder for site owners access, and the backend workings of the site.
    core.php   - the main configuration file included with every page. includes mysql
    dash.php   - the frontend to manage the website.
    manage.php - the frontend to view all the animals
    
    /resources/ - any plugins/resources are stored here
      adminer.php - adminer.php is a lightweight clone of phpmyadmin.
      db.sql      - this is the exported mysql structure
      db_data.sql - this is also the exported sql structure, but with some data
      
    /manage/ - folder for managing animals  
      add.php    - frontend for adding animals
      doAdd.php  - backend for adding animals
      edit.php   - frontend for editing animals
      doEdit.php - backend for editing animals
      doRemove.php - backend for removing animals
    
 * The function doSafe.php in core.php is used everywhere to sanitize inputs before use in SQL statements. But it's an old function I made a while ago, so there could be a better method.The
 * There is no password protecting the admin page.
 * The "import animals" link doesn't work in manage.php.
